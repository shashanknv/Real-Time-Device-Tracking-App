# Real-Time-Decice-Tracking-App
Real-Time Device Tracking App with Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet
This project demonstrates how to build a real-time device tracking application using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io, with Leaflet for map visualization. The application tracks the location of devices in real time and updates their position on a map using geolocation data.

Key Features:
Real-Time Tracking: Utilizes Socket.io to transmit device location updates in real time.
Leaflet Map Integration: Displays and updates the device's location on an interactive map.
Geolocation API: Fetches precise device coordinates with high accuracy.
Dynamic Marker Updates: Adds, moves, and removes markers representing devices on the map as their locations change.
Responsive Front-End: Styled to ensure the map occupies full screen and works across devices.
Setup:
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the server:
bash
Copy code
node app.js
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the map and start tracking.
Technologies Used:
Node.js
Express
Socket.io
Leaflet
Geolocation API
This project is great for learning how to build real-time applications and integrating maps with location services.
