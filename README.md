# Real-Time Device Tracking App with Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time device tracking application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.io**, with **Leaflet** for map visualization. The application tracks the location of devices in real time and updates their position on a map using geolocation data.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Utilizes Socket.io to transmit device location updates in real time.
- **Leaflet Map Integration**: Displays and updates the device's location on an interactive map.
- **Geolocation API**: Fetches precise device coordinates with high accuracy.
- **Dynamic Marker Updates**: Adds, moves, and removes markers representing devices on the map as their locations change.
- **Responsive Front-End**: Styled to ensure the map occupies full screen and works across devices.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
